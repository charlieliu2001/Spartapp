This is a mobile app scheduling app that allows students to easily see what classes they have next in a clear and visual way, and able to house school news and events such as student council election votes.

This project feeds off of the PowerSchool database that houses student class information, and our own Leancloud server that houses information such as news and announcements.

The app was presented to the PowerSchool company, where they incorporated the app's scheduling interface into their very own PowerSchool Mobile app for both iOS and Android, which tops over 100 million users.

Due to the constant changes to the PowerSchool framework, and vast majority of the student body using iOS devices, we decided to discontinue the app.
